To debug uncommon Expo CLI errors effectively, a systematic approach is crucial. Here's a recommended process:

1. **Examine the Full Error Message:** Carefully read the entire error message.  Often, the root cause is hinted at in the details, not just the summary.
2. **Check Expo Documentation:** Consult the official Expo documentation for the specific module or feature causing the issue.  The documentation often includes troubleshooting sections.
3. **Verify Manifest Configurations:** If you're using any Expo modules requiring specific capabilities or settings, double-check your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file to ensure they're correctly configured.
4. **Inspect Package.json:** Ensure all necessary dependencies are correctly listed and installed in your `package.json` file. Run `expo install` to ensure everything is correctly linked.
5. **Simplify Your Code:** Isolate the problematic code section by commenting out parts of your code until you pinpoint the exact location of the error. This helps reduce complexity and identify the source more easily.
6. **Console Logging (Debugging):** Insert `console.log` statements at various points in your code to track variable values, function calls, and the flow of execution.  This can help you understand the state of your app before the error occurs. 
7. **Use Expo's Debug Tools:** Expo offers its own debugging tools (like the Expo Go app and remote debugging capabilities) that can help you identify problems in real time.
8. **Search for Similar Issues:** Search online forums and communities (like Stack Overflow, the Expo forums, or GitHub) for similar error reports. You might find solutions others have already implemented.

By following these debugging strategies and utilizing the code examples provided in `uncommonExpoError.js` and `uncommonExpoErrorSolution.js`, you'll be better equipped to resolve your uncommon Expo CLI errors.
