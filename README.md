This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors encountered when using the Expo CLI and provides solutions for resolving them.  These errors often arise from misconfigurations, missing dependencies, or incorrect usage of Expo modules and are not always easily diagnosed.

## Errors Covered:

* **Incorrect Module Usage:** Improper integration or use of Expo modules or third-party libraries.  This might involve incorrect imports, missing parameters, or misunderstanding of API functions.
